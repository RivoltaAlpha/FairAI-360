## Part 4: Ethical Reflection

For my future projects, I will ensure ethical AI by following these principles:

**Before Starting Any Project**
I'll always ask: "Could this harm anyone?" and "Is this fair to all groups?" If I'm building something that affects people's lives (like a loan approval system or job matching tool), I'll be extra careful about bias and fairness.

**During Development**
I'll use diverse datasets and test my models on different demographic groups. I'll also get feedback from people who might be affected by my system, especially those from underrepresented groups who might spot problems I miss.

**Transparency in My Work**
I'll document my decisions clearly so others can understand how my AI works. If I'm using someone's data, I'll make sure they know and consent to it. I'll also be honest about my system's limitations.

**Ongoing Monitoring**
After deploying any AI system, I'll regularly check if it's working fairly for everyone. If I find problems, I'll fix them quickly rather than ignoring them.
